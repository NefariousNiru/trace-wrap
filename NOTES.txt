Comparing the output of Ping and Traceroute reveals some important details:
Here I have listed some points I observed.

Ping
1. Ping has a range of latency from 13ms to 40ms (Because ping measures RTT without intermediaries)
2. Ping provides end-to-end latency from the request IP to the domain

Traceroute
1. Traceroute has latencies reaching greater than 200ms (Each intermediary - routers in this case, sends back a message which accounts for overhead)
2. Traceroute has many intermediary hops and is more granular
3. Can help in fixing router bottlenecks as it provides more insight
